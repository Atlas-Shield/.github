# Code of Conduct

Weâ€™re a technical community focused on building safer AI agents. We expect everyone to be respectful, helpful, and professional.

## Our standards
- Be welcoming; assume good intent.
- Give constructive feedback; focus on the work, not the person.
- Use inclusive language.
- Respect boundaries around privacy and security.

**Unacceptable behavior** includes harassment, hate speech, threats, doxxing, sexualized language or imagery, sustained disruption, and spamming.

## Scope & enforcement
This Code applies to all Atlas Shield public spaces: GitHub repos, discussions, issues, PRs, and community chats.

Maintainers may remove content or restrict participation for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Email **oss@atlasshield.ai** (community conduct)
- Email **security@atlasshield.ai** (security-related incidents)

We will review and respond in good faith as quickly as we reasonably can.
