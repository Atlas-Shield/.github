# Contributing to Atlas Shield

Thanks for your interest! This organization hosts the public, open-source side of Atlas Shield — “the open firewall for AI agents.”

## How to contribute
1. **Discuss first (for big changes):** open an Issue to agree on scope.
2. **Fork & branch:** `feat/<short-title>` or `fix/<short-title>`.
3. **Commits:** Prefer Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add policy loader`).
4. **Style & tooling**
   - **Python:** ruff, black, pytest
   - **Node/TS:** eslint, prettier, vitest/jest
   - Provide `.env.example` instead of committing secrets.
5. **Tests:** Add/adjust tests so CI passes locally and in GitHub Actions.
6. **Docs:** Update README / docs where behavior or APIs change.
7. **Open a PR:** keep it focused, link related Issues, fill the PR template.
